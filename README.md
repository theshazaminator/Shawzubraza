# Hello World ðŸ‘‹,  I am Shawzub Raza

I am a Wayne State University B.Sc. graduate with degrees in Mathematics, Psychology, and Biomedical Physics. Throughout my life, I have made intentional decisions to enhance my research capacity beginning in high school, when I transferred from my home school to an International Baccalaureate (IB) program. This drive led me to join a university research lab while still in high school, and it has since evolved into publishing and developing papers across interdisciplinary fields. My discipline and passion for mastering complex topics are deeply ingrained in who I am, and I am ambitious to take on the next challenging project.


# Experience 
Game Theory Instructor, Math Corps - Wayne State University (Detroit, MI)                            
_Piloted a Game Theory course within the nationally recognized, NSF-funded Math Corps program_
â€¢	Hired into a senior position, reserved for Ph. Ds, in my first year, contributing to high-level mathematics curriculum design
â€¢	Developed a curriculum that included complex topics of mixed strategies, evolutionary games, and behavioral economics
â€¢	Nominated for a Math Corp Award for exemplifying the programâ€™s mission of mentorship, excellence, and community impact

Decision Science Researcher, Wayne State University (Detroit, MI)                                                                            
_Researching decisions in dating choices between Bio Information and Physical Attractiveness_
â€¢	Developing A/B testing models to analyze decision-making, applying psychological algorithm designs to dating decisions
â€¢	Utilizing ANCOVA models to assess key variables in online dating behavior
â€¢	Currently working on generating participants via paid survey platforms (Prolific)

Strategic Investor Researcher â€“ Behavioral Economics, Wayne State University (Detroit, MI)                       
_Data engineered Monte Carlo simulations in lotteries to analyze under Game Theoretical Approaches_
â€¢	Designed Python-based Monte Carlo simulations to analyze lottery participation dynamics, simulating over 20+ years of data
â€¢	Applied game theory to model lottery participation, revealing a 14% rise in multiple winners during inflation
â€¢	Built decision trees to model lottery payoffs, revealing a $928M inflationary evaluated payoff vs. $495M pre-inflation

Nuclear Data Scientist â€“ Nuclear Physics, Wayne State University (Detroit, MI)                                                     May 2022 â€“ May 2023
_Performed particle collision data analytics from CERN and RHIC_
â€¢	Conducted advanced data analytics using C++ (ROOT, Pythia) to analyze quark flavors in particle collisions
â€¢	Continuously improved over 1,000+ simulations in high-energy nuclear collisions using ALICE data
â€¢	Research identified a 10% increase in strangeness production, supporting QGP formation theories
