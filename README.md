# Hello World ðŸ‘‹,  I'm Shawzub Raza

I am a Wayne State University B.Sc. graduate with degrees in Mathematics, Psychology, and Biomedical Physics. I have extensive research experience spanning Social-Developmental Psychology, Nuclear Physics, Game Theory, Biomedical Physics, and Decision-Making Sciences. My expertise lies in Monte Carlo simulations, predictive analysis, and A/B Testing. I have contributed to new insights in state lottery behavior, with my findings featured in university news outlets. Beyond research, I am deeply passionate about leadershipâ€”founding the SIAM chapter at Wayne State University and promoting the Biomedical Physics program through high school outreach initiatives to help revitalize student interest and enrollment.
